## nnue

Kuma uses an original HalfKP_256x2-32-32 NNUE net trained from self-play with reinforcement learning.

HalfKP-256-32-32-1 is the original size introduced for Shogi in 2018 by Yu Nasu, and integrated into Shogi engine YaneuraOu by Motohiro Isozaki.

HalfKP_256x2-32-32 NNUE was implemented in Stockfish by Hisayori Noda.

HalfKP_256x2-32-32 is the ideal size ~20MB, large enough to hold sufficient data but not too large, which could negatively affect engine performance.
It is simple with features that are fast to calculate.
